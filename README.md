# Agda syntax highlighting in VSCode

This is a syntax highlighting extension for the Agda programming language.

## Features

- Highlight Agda syntax in Agda and Markdown files.

## Setup

The extension is ready to be used straight out of the box. However, there are some settings you can change for a better experience

- You may want to set the option `editor.autoClosingPairs` to `"never"`, as this function interferes with Agda's input-mode.
- If you are writing literate Agda LaTeX code, you may want to rebind the input-mode key from backslash (`\\`) to some other key.

## Release Notes

This is an alpha release.
